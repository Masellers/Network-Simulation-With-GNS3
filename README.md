# Network-Simulation-With-GNS3

In this Project, we are using a program called GNS3 to simulate and practice networking and routing. We will be configuring and pinging a host on another network and using wireshark to capture packets that we are sending.


# Utilities Used

### - GNS3
GNS3 can be downloaded [here](https://www.gns3.com/software/download)

### - OracleBox

### - Wireshark


# **Install GNS3**

### Install
You will need to make an account first in order to download but after downloading GNS3 you can follow the install guide provided by GNS3 [here](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/getting-started/installation/windows/). The installer will ask if you want to sign-up for and install SolarWinds but this is optional.

### Network Setup
We will be configuring a network using the following model with the goal of successfully pinging from one host to the other.
