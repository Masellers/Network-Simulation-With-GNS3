# Network-Simulation-With-GNS3

In this Project, we are using a program called GNS3 to simulate and practice networking and routing a basic network.


# Systems Used

### GNS3
[GNS3 Download](https://www.gns3.com/software/download)

### OracleBox


# **Step 1: Install GNS3**

### Install
You will need to make an account first in order to download but after downloading GNS3 you can follow the install guide provided by GNS3 [here](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/getting-started/installation/windows/). The installer will ask if you want to sign-up for and install SolarWinds but this is optional.

### Aquire IP Address
To learn our IP adress, we can use the command `ifconfig`, since we are using linux and `ipconfig` if we were using windows. Our IP address is the one labeled `inet addr:192.168.56.101`. This is what it is here but the actual ip address will most likely look different on your machine. 

We can also type this address into our web browser to see a screen that looks like this: 
<img src="" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Me"/>
